## Step 1: Download the AdbeRdr910\_en\_US.exe file
 
The first step is to download the AdbeRdr910\_en\_US.exe file from the official Adobe FTP site. This is the version that does not contain AIR and Acrobat.com[^1^]. You can use this link to access the file: [ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/9.x/9.1/enu/AdbeRdr910\_en\_US.exe](ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/win/9.x/9.1/enu/AdbeRdr910_en_US.exe). Save the file to your desired location on your computer.
 
## Step 2: Run the AdbeRdr910\_en\_US.exe file
 
The next step is to run the AdbeRdr910\_en\_US.exe file that you downloaded. Double-click on the file and follow the instructions on the screen to install Adobe Reader 9.1. You do not need to customize any settings or use any tools to disable AIR and Acrobat.com, as they are not included in this version of the file.
 
## Step 3: Enjoy Adobe Reader 9.1 without AIR and Acrobat.com
 
Once the installation is complete, you can launch Adobe Reader 9.1 from your Start menu or desktop shortcut. You should be able to view, print, and comment on PDF files without any issues. You will also notice that there are no icons or links for AIR and Acrobat.com in your Adobe Reader interface.
 
### Troubleshooting
 
If you encounter any problems with installing or using Adobe Reader 9.1 without AIR and Acrobat.com, here are some possible solutions:
 
- Make sure you download the correct version of the file (AdbeRdr910\_en\_US.exe) from the official Adobe FTP site[^1^]. Do not use any other sources or versions of the file, as they may contain AIR and Acrobat.com or other unwanted features.
- If you have previously installed Adobe Reader with AIR and Acrobat.com, you may need to uninstall them before installing Adobe Reader 9.1 without them. You can use the Windows Control Panel or a third-party uninstaller tool to remove them from your computer.
- If you want to extract the MSI file from the AdbeRdr910\_en\_US.exe file and use a customization tool to create a MST file for deployment purposes, make sure you use the correct MSI file (3,878 KB) and deselect AIR in the customization tool[^2^]. Otherwise, you may end up installing AIR and Acrobat.com along with Adobe Reader 9.1.
- If you have any questions or issues with Adobe Reader 9.1 without AIR and Acrobat.com, you can visit the Adobe Support Community[^1^] and ask for help from other users or experts.
